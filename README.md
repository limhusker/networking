# JSON-Based Networking Framework

This file is part of the networking module https://github.com/cgloeckner/networking. The project offers a networking framework for games and other software using json-styled data. It's main purpose is to integrate into my own game project as well as integrate it into FLARE by Clint Bellanger one day.

The source code is licenced under MIT. See COPYING for further information.

Kind regards, Christian Gl√∂ckner

# JSON over plain data

The first approach for my networking framework was about using plain data. I collected primitive values in structures (called "events") and sent them over the network. For correct identification it was necessary to give unique id to each event type and switch them after receiving. This whole ugly switching and typecasting can be reduced when using serialized data. Because of it's low overhead I decided to use JSON! It is also ready-to-use for maintenance and easy to read for humans.

# Dependencies

- C++11
- SDL_net (currently customized for version 1.2)

# Current Limitations

Currently there is no UDP support. The server-client code is completly based on TCP only. I'm not shure whether I already need UDP, so it will stay disabled for a non-specified while. Also multiple endianness is not supported. Consider this when shipping your application using the framework to different plattforms.

Please pay attention to use `float` for floating point variables in the context of JSON Objects. Currenty `double` or `long double` are not supported, because some decimal place might be cut off when serializing with `std::to_string`.

# Example

You can find a server-client-based chatroom example in the directory `example/`. It shoulds the basic usage of a possible multiuser chatroom.

# Building

Note: This Framework is a header-only framework. Just include the header-files and get ready!

Build with Code::Blocks is most simple. Just use `networking.cbp` and build as you always do. If you are using GCC without building can be done by the following line.

    g++ -o chatroom example/*.cpp -lSDL_net --std=c++0x -pthread -I./include/

I testet it using GNU/Linux Ubuntu 12.04 32-Bit and gcc 4.6.3. But it should work with MinGW as-well. Just remember too add e.g. `-lmingw32` (I had to add when compiling using Wine on my 32-bit machine.)

# Scheduled Changes

- use boost::asio instead SDL_net
- seperate callback-map from client/server for less "over-template" structure
- make serialization more general (e.g. type parameter), so json is ONE possibilty
