Building:
--------

To build the module and demo application using gcc you can use:

	g++ -o demo src/*.cpp example/*.cpp demo.cpp -lSDL

I testet it using GNU/Linux Ubuntu 12.04 32-Bit and gcc 4.6.3.


Scheduled Changes:
----------------

Here are some ideas as my personal to-do-list:

    - write some TCP-/UDP-based stuff using sdl_net
    
    - modify example using networking
