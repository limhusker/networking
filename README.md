Building:
--------

To build the module and simple demo application using gcc you can use:

    g++ -o demo src/*.cpp example1.cpp -lSDL -lSDL_net --std=c++0x

To build the module and complex demo application using gcc you can use:

    g++ -o demo src/*.cpp example2.cpp -lSDL -lSDL_net --std=c++0x

I testet it using GNU/Linux Ubuntu 12.04 32-Bit and gcc 4.6.3.


Scheduled Changes:
----------------

    - much more testing :D 
    - extend server-client with udp stuff:
        - server.enable_udp(port)
        - server.disable_udp()
        - tcp port given in constructor as before
        --> tcp is always used, udp is optional
    - worker can open udp connection to client after tcp acception
